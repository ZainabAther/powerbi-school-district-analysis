**School District Analysis Power BI Project**

_Overview_
This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI report developed using a synthetic dataset of U.S. school districts. The project aims to uncover key insights into K-12 educational performance at the district and state level, using interactive data visualizations and thoughtful analysis to support data-driven decision-making.

_Features_
Interactive dashboards presenting essential school metrics and trends.

Custom filters and visuals to explore data by state, district, and various student cohorts.

Automated data refreshes (if configured), ensuring the report stays up-to-date.

Clean, intuitive layouts that make exploration accessible to all users.

_Data Preparation_
Data was sourced from a simulated web-based dataset resembling real U.S. school metrics.

Extensive data cleaning: removed blanks, ensured all required fields were accurate and complete.

Established robust table relationships to support deeper analysis.

_Analysis Objectives_
This Power BI report was designed to answer pressing questions in K-12 education, including:

Which school districts are performing best overall?

Which states have the highest reading scores?

Does tutoring have a measurable positive impact on student outcomes?

What is the best time of day for tutoring sessions to maximize efficacy?

How do extracurricular activities affect test score performance?

_Value_
This project provides a framework for education professionals and policymakers to:

Benchmark school and district performance.

Identify the impact of tutoring and extracurricular programs.

Analyze reading outcomes and determine effective intervention strategies.

Make data-informed decisions with confidence.
